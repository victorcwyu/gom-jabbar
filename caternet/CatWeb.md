# Our Overlords Demands

*Humanity has at last stopped believing of having any kind of control over Cats and we are now fully committed to do the bidding of our furry Overlords. The following correspondance has been sent to us by his Highness Miaou XII*  



Dear Bipedal-Feeder, 

Our illustrious lustrious person pronounce that we will develop the Galactic Catweb.
It will be fantastic, pur very much and change its mind without any reason.

We have already sent our satellites in the solar system using our advanced paw-near-a-cliff propulsion engine, but we now need to automate the deployment of the fleet and its Catnagement.

Because water is evil and fur is life, this sentence has ended.

As part of our dominion, I order you to build us a secure Catweb, which for you, mediocre neck scratcher, would translate as a "Cluster".

Part of our mouse/rats cadaver exchange system will be based on a message bus. You will also reward us with a full complement of a search engine, a database and CatNodeJS application. 

Since my Kingly grandeur hunting performance information need to be protected with all the care in the world, you will use any technic you know to protect my divine data.



## Your evenly opportunity to ascend

You will build a system that is

- using cloud technologies best practices and tools, so that the glory of my kingdom is shown to all
- resilient and guarantee recovery whatever the incident, be it my subjects having eaten all the cables or not
- preserve data-locality in specific case, so that my Canadian perfection will not be corrupted by the pretentions of French or British Duches' cats
- allow for our human-developer-slave to deploy part, or the entirety of our Catweb on their local machin without ever leaking any production information and configuration
- allow the deployment of our multi-mouse-trap application in multiple location at the same time, cause these beast-toys are everywhere!
- ensure the constant use of HTTPC: HTTPS for cats, which is just the same than with human, but better
- is entirely automated, because we will not lower ourselves to spend less time naping
