Hello candidate!



We are super excited that you have been selected and interested to take on our technical challenge!

## Principle
This is meant for you to demonstrate your talent.

You do ***NOT*** need to:

- *do them all*: unless you're really feeling it and have the time, ***one*** project is enough for us to have a very intersting conversation about your approach and code 💡
- *finish the project completely*: it is for you to decide what is enough code, documentation, tests, configuration, ... to demonstrate your talents!🏋🏻‍♀️
- *pick the exact stack we use*: if you can demonstrate you know Node, Rust or React/Svelte, that's good, but if you're a king of Python and Haskell, and you can show us fantastic code with it, prioritize impressing us 💪
- *pick the one you think will please us: this is meant to be fun, pick one of the project you think you can enjoy doing, we're not looking for anything else than software talent ❤️



## Base requirement

To facilitate ***our*** life 💁‍♂️while reviewing everybody's challenges, it would be immensily appreciated if you can:

- *ensure we can build it*: even if it's unfinished, we should always commit working code, shouldn't we? 
  So if your component is unfinished, it's fine, but let's make it so that it display logs/empty space but do not crash or reboot our smart cat feeder (🐈😻). Also do not expect us to have the planet installed locally. Make sure you list what's needed to be able to build. 
- *demonstrate your best work*: actions speak louder than words! 
  we're not exactly interested in what you '***would do***' in the best of world where unicorn are reviewing our code and giving us super-testing powers, but really what you **<u>do</u>** day-to-day when we have a sneaky bug to crush before Thursday's beer 🍻 and we're still in the middle of a pandemic. Tips: make sure your submission match your usual standard... 😉
- *submit your result as a PR*: yup, in Github and ideally with nice wit-filled commit message. 
  Put your answer for a specific challenge inside it's own directory, avoid deleting the other challenge folders! Also, we <u>will</u> reject it in the end...<u>Don't panic!</u> 
  It means we made a decision and we want to keep our repo clean for the next candidates. Your submission will always be in our heart, especially if it's good.
- *test your submission*: put yourself in our shoes. double-check.👓
  Git clone the repo under a different name locally, then make sure everything is squeaky when it's building. Unfortunatly, we will spend exactly 5 min trying to make it work if it doesn't. Make the best of it those 5 min👸🏻 
- ***<u>have fun!</u>***
